# RWTH Notes: Computer Vision, Geometry Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Intro to Bioinformatics

Here, I have compiled all lecture notes that could be helpful for RWTH students enrolled in the course. There is no guarantee of completeness or accuracy, so use with caution.

_Remarks:_
While the Computer Vision and Geometry notes are referenced from 'panikzettel.philworld.de', I have merely utilized their LaTeX template and am not affiliated with the group.
